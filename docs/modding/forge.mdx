Thanks to SKlauncher 3.1 installing Forge is a really quick and simple process. Here's what you will need to do to install it:

1. Go to the **Installations Manager** and create a new installation.
2. In the version chooser select **Forge** and choose desired Minecraft version.
3. Customize the installation to your liking and save it.
4. Done!

To add mods:

1. Right click on the newly created installation and click on **Open Installation Directory** from the context menu. (Note: For linux users this may not work. Just open the .minecraft folder)
2. Create a new folder named "mods"
3. Add your Forge mods
4. Done!
